# About

Luna is a videogame editor I worked on as a side project, specifically aimed at
creating 2D top-down games (similar to SNES RPGs). The types of files it would
allow for editing include sprites, animations, tilesets, and maps, although
currently, there isn't much functionality there. The app is written using Svelte,
and was created mostly as a way for me to become familiar with front-end web
development. Initially, I wrote a version in Vue, which has more progress and
can be found [here](https://github.com/litearc/luna-vue).
